# Netspresso: a non-invasive power sensor for coffee availability 
by Alfred Langerbeck - al226nm

## Introduction
The netspresso project is built to help satisfy one of the basic human needs, Coffee!!
The basic purpose is to measure when a device, in this case a coffee brewer, is powered on. In addition, the power draw of the device is measured.
This is a pretty easy problem to solve and in fact i have already made a simple project to do this before by modifying a standard coffee brewer. 
The previous solution was shut down quite quickly when a building manager walked in and saw the construction, called it a fire hazard and kindly told us not
to modify devices in this way in the future. So how do you do this without modifying the device and not having to worry about working with the power in the mains directly.

In this project, a split core transformer is used to measure the current that is drawn by the coffee maker with minimal interference with the device itself.
The project took about a week of evenings (~20 hours) to complete, and I hope my experience with the project will help anyone who wants to do anything like this. 

Give a short and brief overview of what your project is about. What needs to be included:
    Title
    Your name and student credentials (xx666x)
    Short project overview
    How much time it might take to do (approximation)

## Objective
As stated earlier, the objective is to create a device that can detect when a coffee maker or another general device without interfering with the device itself, and more importantly without modifying it or directly disturbing power from mains. The measurements are then to be uploaded, so any interested party can check if there is coffee brewing or if there was some coffee made recently. 

The project touched many different techniques and was a perfect start for interacting with MQTT, IC2, DACs, Wi-Fi, Sockets and very light data analysis.




Describe why you have chosen to build this specific device. What purpose does it serve? What do you want to do with the data, and what new insights do you think it will give?

#### Raspberry pi pico w
The Raspberry pi picp is a microcontroller with wireless capabilities and is the core of this project. It does the computing and comunication with sensors. 
One great benefit of this board is that it is wifi capable and can easily be programed using Micropython

</p>

#### SCT-013
This is the main sensor in the project. It is a split core transformer which measures the current through a wire. It works by the phenomenon of induced current from the field 
created from an ac current. The transformer can measure a current up to 30 Amp and will produce an output between 0 and 1 volt relating to this current.

</p>

#### ADS1115
The ADS1115 is a an external analog to digital converter. It was deemed that the onboard ADC on the raspberry pi was not enought and this was choosen since it was 
easy to do the differnetial input setup needed to calculate the AC voltage from the current transformer. The ADC came without headers soldered on so this needed to be self soldered.

</p>

#### Connections
The remaining components were used to connect the the components togheter. Since the SCT-013 connects with a 3.5 mm AUX cable an audio jack was also used to create an easy
connection. The breadboard is a good place to connect components with clear lines and without needing to solder. Finaly there are of course some wires to connect components.

#### Solder material
If you have soldering materials and tools lying around, which i had soldering is a good way to make your device more permanent.
I used and empty pcb, wire, solder and a soldering iron for the process. I also used female headers to make the ADC and Microcontroler easily removable.

Explain all material that is needed. All sensors, where you bought them and their specifications. Please also provide pictures of what you have bought and what you are using.

    List of material
    What the different things (sensors, wires, controllers) do - short specifications
    Where you bought them and how much they cost

## Computer setup
After collecting all materials needed you should start thinking about your developing envoirment and how you want to interact with the raspberry pi pico w.
All the programatic and setup parts of this project were done usign a pc runnin windows 10 but there should be no problems doing the same project using any other
computer. You could even use a regular raspberry pi!

### Firmware
<img align="right" src="/doc/micropython.png" width="200"/>
To begin using the raspberry pi pico w microcontroller you first need to install a firmware. For this project [Micropython](https://micropython.org/) was choosen. The firmware contains a low lever python operating system for the microcontroller which allows its many properties to be contorlled with python code. Micropython contains a subset of the python standard library. After installing the firmware the microcontroller can both be uploaded with files to run when no connected with a computer and controlled via an interactive prompr over usb.



1. The firmware can be downloaded [here] (https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/) under the "Firmware" heading. In this project version 1.20.0 was used.

2. After downloading the fimrware it needs to be uploaded to the microcontroller. This is done by holding done the "BOOTSEL" button indicated in black beloow and pluggin the microcontroller
into your computer using a usb micro cable.

    <em>https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w/1</em>
</p>

3. A file explorer will pop up which looks something like below. Drag and drop the file you downloaded into the file manager. It should close and the microcontroller should restart.

### Programing the microcontroller

Writing the code for the project i used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is an IDE which a large amount of user created moduels which helps you with a vareity of tasks.
I especially found the [pico-w-go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) usefull since it provides autocompletion for the version of Micropython used in the project. Instuction on how to install the extension can be found by following the provided link.

How is the device programmed. Which IDE are you using. Describe all steps from flashing the firmware, installing plugins in your favorite editor. How flashing is done on MicroPython. The aim is that a beginner should be able to understand.
